        <h2>Hi, I am Analita, but go by Ana!</h2>
        <p>This isn't my official portfolio which is why it is called "Warlita's Corner" and where I plan to add on cool
            things I make here. The goal is to incorporate fun things I learn so I can continue to build on this project.
            <br>
            I know it's not pretty. However, as someone who has been stuck
            in many tutorials since as I am unable to pay money for a proper bootcamp and needed to submit a solo project
            for V46 in Chingu, I realized I should start building.
            <br>
            I currently work in the software world as a Tier 2 Technical Support Specialist where I have to work closely
            with our
            client-facing teams to troubleshoot, educate, test, and duplicate known/reported bugs found in the software.
            <br>
            <br>
            This solo project transitioned a simple CLI game into a GUI with every intention to continue building on this
            into the future.
